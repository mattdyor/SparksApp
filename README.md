# SparksApp

SparksApp is a mobile application featuring a collection of micro-experiences ("sparks") - interactive, vibe-coded experiences like spin the wheel, flashcards, and business simulations. Built with React Native and Expo, it offers a modular platform for small, engaging utilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18+)
*   npm or yarn
*   Expo Go app on your mobile device (optional, for testing)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dyor/SparksApp.git
    cd SparksApp
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Firebase configuration:
        ```bash
        EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
        EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
        EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
        EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.firebasestorage.app
        EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
        EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
        EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
        ```
    *   Get these values from Firebase Console (Project Settings > General > Your apps > Web app)
    *   You will need to create a Firebase project and enable Firestore and Authentication (Anonymous).
    *   **Important:** All Firebase environment variables must use the `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix.

4.  **Start the app**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
    *   Scan the QR code with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS).

## Codespaces Quick Start

Want to develop in the cloud? SparksApp fully supports GitHub Codespaces for Expo Go development.

### Getting Started with Codespaces

1.  **Open in Codespace**
    *   Click "Code" > "Codespaces" > "Create codespace on main"
    *   Wait for the container to build (3-5 minutes first time)
    *   Setup script will automatically run

2.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    *   Edit the `.env` file created from `.env.example`
    *   Add your Firebase credentials (get from [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/))
    *   Add your Gemini API key (get from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))

3.  **Start Expo with Tunnel**
    ```bash
    npx expo start --tunnel
    ```
    *   **Note:** Use `--tunnel` flag for cloud development (required for Codespaces)

4.  **Connect Your Phone**
    *   Install [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) on your iOS or Android device
    *   Open Expo Go and scan the QR code
    *   App will load and hot reload as you make changes

### Why Tunnel Mode?

Codespaces runs in the cloud, so your phone can't reach it via local network. The `--tunnel` flag creates a public URL that your phone can access from anywhere.

### Troubleshooting Codespaces

*   **Can't connect?** Make sure port 8081 is public in Codespace port settings
*   **Hot reload not working?** Restart Metro bundler: Stop (Ctrl+C) and run `npx expo start --tunnel` again
*   **Environment variables not working?** Restart Metro after editing `.env`

For detailed Codespaces documentation, see [CONTEXT/GENERAL/CODESPACESPLAN.md](CONTEXT/GENERAL/CODESPACESPLAN.md).
