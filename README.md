# Contributing New Sparks

We welcome contributions! There are three ways you can add new sparks to the app, ranging from a simple in-app wizard to full code contributions via GitHub.

## 1. Using the Spark Wizard (In-App)

The most user-friendly way to contribute is directly through the interface of the Sparks app.

1.  **Install the App:**
    - **Android:** [Google Play Store Listing ↗](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mattdyor.sparks)
    - **iOS:** [iOS App Store Listing ↗](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/get-sparks/id6752919846)
2.  **Open the Wizard:** Navigate to the **Spark Wizard** within the app.
3.  **Create:** Follow the step-by-step prompts to define your spark's content.
4.  **Submit:** Submit your spark for review directly through the app.

> **Note:** The Spark Wizard allows you to share.

## 2. Using GitHub Codespaces

Use a pre-configured cloud environment to add sparks via the codebase without any local setup.

# [Create Codespace]([https://linkly.link/2TcvP](https://github.com/codespaces/new?skip_quickstart=true&machine=standardLinux32gb&repo=1048220194&ref=main&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json&geo=UsWest))

1.  **Create a Codespace:** Click [this link](https://github.com/codespaces/new?skip_quickstart=true&machine=standardLinux32gb&repo=1048220194&ref=main&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json&geo=UsWest) to launch the environment.
2.  **Edit with Agent:** Use the built-in Copilot/AI agent to help generate or modify the spark files.
    - _Tip:_ You can tell the Agent to build a new spark based on an existing one but with the changes you want, and it will usually handle it with ease.
    - **Sample Prompt**: Try this example to build a Hangman game:
      ```
      Build a Spark called Hangman. There are 1-4 players. The user will be asked how many
      players when they visit the spark. If 1 player, jump into the game. If 2-4, then it
      will say 'Hand the phone to Player 1 to enter the word' with an option to enter the
      word and click Start. Once Player 1 clicks then jump into the game by identifying the
      Player that is up, an ASCII art hangman structure, the number of letters presented as
      _, and all of the letters of the alphabet in little pill boxes. As the player pushes
      a letter, if it is present in the word draw it in, and if not draw the next piece of
      the hangman. Start by reviewing instructions in the AGENT.md file in the top directory.
      ```
3.  **Preview Your Change:** Use the VS Code task **Start Expo Web** (recommended) to start the Expo web server and preview the app.

    ```bash
    # If needed, you can still run the CLI manually from a terminal:
    npx expo start --web -c
    ```

    This will provide a web-based preview of the app so you can verify your spark looks correct.

4.  **Submit a PR:**
    - Open the **Source Control** tab in the sidebar.
    - Commit your changes.
    - Click **"Create Pull Request"** to submit your changes to the main repository.

**Note:** The Sparks Codespace has pre-configured controls at the bottom of the screen to help you preview changes (via a web page) and publish your changes (via a GitHub pull request or PR).

## 3. Forking the Repository

For developers who prefer a traditional Git workflow.

1.  **Fork the Repo:** Navigate to [dyor/SparksApp](https://github.com/dyor/SparksApp) and click **Fork** to create a copy under your account.
2.  **Make Changes:** Add your new spark files or edit an existing one within your fork.
3.  **Submit the Pull Request:**
    - Once your changes are pushed to your fork, go to the **Pull Requests** tab of the original `dyor/SparksApp` repository.
    - Click **New Pull Request** and then **"compare across forks"**.
    - Select your fork and branch, then click **Create Pull Request**.

> **Important Note:** Each PR should either improve a **single** existing Spark or create a **new** Spark. Changes spanning multiple Sparks will likely be rejected. If you are building a new Spark, it is fine to base it off an existing Spark (make it better). We look forward to seeing what you build!

**For detailed contribution guidelines, code style, and best practices, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).**

## Getting Started (if you decide to Fork)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn
- Expo Go app on your mobile device (optional, for testing)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dyor/SparksApp.git
    cd SparksApp
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables**

    - Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Firebase configuration:
      ```bash
      EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
      EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
      EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
      EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.firebasestorage.app
      EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
      EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
      EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
      ```
    - Get these values from Firebase Console (Project Settings > General > Your apps > Web app)
    - You will need to create a Firebase project and enable Firestore and Authentication (Anonymous).
    - **Important:** All Firebase environment variables must use the `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix.

4.  **Start the app**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
    - Scan the QR code with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS).
